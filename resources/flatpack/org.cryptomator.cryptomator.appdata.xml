    <description>
        Multi-platform transparent client-side encryption of your files in the cloud.

        ## Features

        - Works with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, ownCloud, Nextcloud and any other cloud storage service which synchronizes with a local directory
        - Open Source means: No backdoors, control is better than trust
        - Client-side: No accounts, no data shared with any online service
        - Totally transparent: Just work on the virtual drive as if it were a USB flash drive
        - AES encryption with 256-bit key length
        - File names get encrypted
        - Folder structure gets obfuscated
        - Use as many vaults in your Dropbox as you want, each having individual passwords
        - One thousand commits for the security of your data!! :tada:

        ### Privacy

        - 256-bit keys (unlimited strength policy bundled with native binaries)
        - Scrypt key derivation
        - Cryptographically secure random numbers for salts, IVs and the masterkey of course
        - Sensitive data is wiped from the heap asap
        - Lightweight: [Complexity kills security](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1999/11/a_plea_for_simplicit.html)

        ### Consistency

        - HMAC over file contents to recognize changed ciphertext before decryption
        - I/O operations are transactional and atomic, if the filesystems support it
        - Each file contains all information needed for decryption (except for the key of course), no common metadata means no [SPOF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure)

        ### Security Architecture
